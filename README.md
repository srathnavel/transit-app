# How People Get to Work
## Dashboarding with shiny

This dashboard maps how commuters using different modes of transport to get to work are distributed around city centers. This was my final project for Data Visualization (STAT 302) at Northwestern in Winter 2022. The project prompt was to create any set of visualizations in R. It is hosted at https://shruti820.shinyapps.io/TransportApp/
