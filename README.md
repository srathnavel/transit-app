# How People Get to Work
## Dashboarding with shiny

This dashboard maps the distribution of commuters using different modes of transport to get to work in Chicago, NYC, and LA. This was my final project for Data Visualization with R (STAT 302) at Northwestern University in March 2022. I modified it afterwards to include a workflow for reproducible data updates using the IPUMS API. The dashboard is hosted at https://shruti820.shinyapps.io/TransportApp/
