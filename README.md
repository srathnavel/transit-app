# How People Get to Work
## Dashboarding with shiny

This dashboard maps the distribution of commuters using different modes of transport to get to work. This was my final project for Data Visualization with R (STAT 302) at Northwestern in Winter 2022. I modified it afterwards to include a workflow for easier and reproducible data updates using the IPUMS API. It is hosted at https://shruti820.shinyapps.io/TransportApp/
